This attempt uses the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF standard</a> as the base and utilizes <a href="https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki">DOAP</a> and <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> extensions.
These are standards used by many organizations including <a href="http://www-archive.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://projects.apache.org/doap.html">Apache</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python</a>, and <a href="http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jruby/doap">codehaus</a>. Moving forward, JBoss will also make use of
these standards for maintaining project metadata.</p><h2>What do I need to do?</h2><p>We have a <a href="form.html">form</a> for you to fill out which will create a basic DOAP file. Any customization after the
initial creation of the file is up to you. There are many other elements which are supported by RDF / DOAP which are not included
in the form such as maintainers, documentors, screenshots, and blog url. The linked form contains the values we will be using,
however, not every field is required. Required fields are indicated by your browser. The form makes use of HTML5 elements and
features. It has been tested in Chrome and Firefox. Most fields should be fairly self explanatory. Unless the field is a drop down
field the text is freeform. Fields which require a URL must contain a fully valid URL including protocol. For the logo field, please
use the 200x150 pixel logo provided by the design team for your project.</p><p>Once the form has been filled out, click the "Generate DOAP" button (any errors will be indicated) which will create the XML file and
will enable the "Download DOAP" button. Clicking the download button will download a "doap.rdf" file. Feel free to rename that file
if you see fit. You may also modify the file after generation. After you are happy with your file, please email <a href="mailto:help@jboss.org?subject=Request%20for%20adding%20project%20DOAP%20file">help@jboss.org</a> with your completed DOAP file.</p><p><a href="form.html">Continue to form</a></p></body></html>
